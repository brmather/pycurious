    "It is notoriously difficult to estimate uncertainties from Curie depth determinations. Intuitively, the fewer points in the power spectrum should result in higher uncertainty, but it is difficult to quantify these uncertainties in practise. For [Bouligand *et al.*, 2009](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1029/2009JB006494) it is difficult to determine the values of $\\beta$ and $\\Delta z$ since both control the slope of the power spectrum at low wavenumbers. Similarly, for [Tanaka *et al.*, 1999](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040195199000724) the lower and upper ranges of the power spectrum used to compute $z_b$ and $z_t$ is highly subjective and can result in significantly different Curie depths.\n",

The approach we outline here is not necessarily the most statistically robust methodology, but it is intended as a practical way forward to compute Curie depth while considering the high degree of uncertainty."

    "Due to the deterministic approach that [Tanaka *et al.*, 1999](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040195199000724) uses for estimating $Z_b$, the uncertainties returned by `CurieGrid.tanaka1999` are the simple results of error propagation from the initial spectra uncertainties. It should also be noted that the spectra uncertainties represent the variance within the sampled sector of the 2D FFT, and may comprise both noise and anisotropic signal.\n",
