    "Magnetic data is one of the most common geophysics datasets available on the surface of the Earth. Curie depth is the depth at which rocks lose their magnetism. The most prevalent magnetic mineral is magnetite, which has a Curie point of 580°C, thus the Curie depth is often interpreted as the 580°C isotherm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current methods to derive Curie depth first compute the (fast) Fourier transform over a square window of a magnetic anomaly that has been reduced to the pole. The depth and thickness of magnetic sources is estimated from the slope of the radial power spectrum. `pycurious` implements the Tanaka *et al.* (1999) and Bouligand *et al.* (2009) methods for computing the thickness of a buried magnetic source, which are covered within Jupyter notebooks.\n",

    "There are two matching sets of Jupyter notebooks - one set for the [Tanaka](#Tanaka) and one for [Bouligand](#Bouligand) implementations. The Bouligand set of noteboks are a natural choice for Bayesian inference applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "- [`numpy`](http://numpy.org)\n",
    "- [`scipy`](https://scipy.org)\n",
    "- [`cython`](https://cython.org/)\n",

    "### Installing using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install `pycurious` using the\n",
    "[`pip package manager`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) with either version of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python2 -m pip install pycurious\n",
    "python3 -m pip install pycurious\n",
    "```\n",
    "All the dependencies will be automatically installed by `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing using Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "A more straightforward installation for `pycurious` and all of its dependencies may be deployed with [Docker](https://www.docker.com).\n",
    "To install the docker image and start the Jupyter notebook examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker pull brmather/pycurious:latest\n",
    "docker run --name pycurious -p 8888:8888 brmather/pycurious:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "PyCurious consists of 2 classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CurieGrid`: base class that computes radial power spectrum, centroids for processing, decomposition of subgrids.\n",
    "- `CurieOptimise`: optimisation module for fitting the synthetic power spectrum (inherits CurieGrid).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also included is a `mapping` module for gridding scattered data points, and converting between coordinate reference systems (CRS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple workflow to calculate the radial power spectrum:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pycurious\n",
    "\n",
    "# initialise CurieOptimise object with 2D magnetic anomaly\n",
    "grid = pycurious.CurieOptimise(mag_anomaly, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\n",
    "\n",
    "# extract a square window of the magnetic anomaly\n",
    "subgrid = grid.subgrid(window_size, x, y)\n",
    "\n",
    "# compute the radial power spectrum\n",
    "k, Phi, sigma_Phi = grid.radial_spectrum(subgrid)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of tests are located in the *tests* subdirectory.\n",
    "In order to perform these tests, clone the repository and run [`pytest`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout https://github.com/brmather/pycurious.git\n",
    "cd pycurious\n",
    "pytest -v\n",
    "```\n",

    "### API Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The API for all functions and classes in `pycurious` can be accessed from [https://brmather.github.io/pycurious/](https://brmather.github.io/pycurious/).\n",
